# UPDATE

This project includes the starter code, but also changes. A line chart is now shown when a list item, stock, is clicked. Changes also include basic input control to letters only and validation of stock symbol input.

## How To Use Stock Hawk

### Initial Start-up

Each list item displays the symbol and either the price change or the percentage change from the last data update. To swap between the price and percentage change, click the icon on the right side of the toolbar. When the price is displayed, the icon will be a percent symbol (%). When the percentage change is displayed, the icon will be the dollar symbol ($).

#### Adding A Stock Symbol

To add a stock to the list, click the floating action button. A dialogue box appears, allowing the user to enter a valid stock symbol (i.e. MMM for 3M). Once the symbol is verified, it is added to the list on the main screen. Clicking on a list item will launch a details screen. The details screen is a line graph of stock prices from the previous week.

#### Deleting A Stock Symbol

To remove a stock symbol from the list, swipe the list item to the left or right.
